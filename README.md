# TICTACTOE-GAME
<br>
**Tic-Tac-Toe Game ðŸŽ® This is a Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that I developed after watching CodeWithHarry's tutorial. While inspired by the tutorial, I have made some modifications to the code, adding my own logic and enhancements.<br> 
Features: <br>
âœ… Single-player & Multiplayer Modes â€“ Play against a friend or challenge the AI.<br>
âœ… Improved Code Logic â€“ My version has optimized decision-making and structure.<br>
âœ… User-friendly Interface â€“ Clear console-based game prompts.<br>
âœ… Error Handling â€“ Ensures valid moves and prevents crashes. <br>
âœ… Custom Enhancements â€“ Some tweaks and personal touches to improve gameplay.**
