# TICTACTOE-GAME
**Tic-Tac-Toe Game ðŸŽ® This is a Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that I developed after watching CodeWithHarry's tutorial. While inspired by the tutorial, I have made some modifications to the code, adding my own logic and enhancements.  
Features: 
âœ… Single-player & Multiplayer Modes â€“ Play against a friend or challenge the AI.
âœ… Improved Code Logic â€“ My version has optimized decision-making and structure.
âœ… User-friendly Interface â€“ Clear console-based game prompts.
âœ… Error Handling â€“ Ensures valid moves and prevents crashes. 
âœ… Custom Enhancements â€“ Some tweaks and personal touches to improve gameplay.**
